         *  Multimap is a generalization of a map or associative array data type in which
            more than one value may be associate with and returned for a given key[Wiki].
            Create a generic multimap – a data structure which holds multiple values at a key.
            This means we can add multiple values for a single key in a dictionary.
            The implemented type should implement IDictionary interface (generic one
            defined in System.Collections.Generic namespace), i.e. all methods defined in the
            interface should be implemented.
