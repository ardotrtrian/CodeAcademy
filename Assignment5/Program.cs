    Create the following class hierarchy:
    • Person - general class for anyone, which has id, first name and last name.
    o Employee - general class for all employees, holding the field salary and department. 
    The department can only have one of the following values: Production, Accounting, Sales or Marketing.
    ▪ Manager – holds a set of employees under his/her command.
    ▪ RegularEmployee
    • SalesEmployee – holds a set of sales. A sale hold product name, date
    and price.
    • Developer - holds a set of projects. A project holds project name,
    project start date, details and a project state (open or closed).
    o Customer – hold the net purchase amount (total amount of money the customer has spent).

    Extract interfaces for each class (IPerson, IEmployee, IManager, etc.) The interfaces should hold their
    public properties and methods. Each class (Person, Employee, Manager, etc.) should implement its respective interface.

    Avoid code duplication through abstraction; encapsulate all data.
    Override ToString() in all classes to print details information about the object.
    Create several employees of type Manager, SalesEmployee and Developer and add them into a single collection and print them.
